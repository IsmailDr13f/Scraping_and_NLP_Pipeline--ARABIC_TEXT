# Scraping_and_NLP_Pipeline--ARABIC_TEXT
 During the proposed lab, we learn various techniques related to web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and named entity recognition (NER) applied to Arabic web sources within a specific domain. Here's a brief of what we learned:

1. Web Scraping: we learn to use libraries like Scrapy and Beautiful Soup to extract data from Arabic web sources relevant to a specific domain. we understand the basics of navigating through web pages, identifying relevant content, and retrieving it programmatically.

2. Data Storage: Raw data obtained from web scraping is stored in a NoSQL database, specifically MongoDB. They learn how to structure and manage data within MongoDB, allowing for efficient storage and retrieval of scraped information.

3. NLP Pipeline**: we establishe a Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipeline, which involves several preprocessing steps such as text cleaning, tokenization, removal of stop words, discretization, and normalization. These steps are crucial for preparing text data for further analysis and modeling.

4. Stemming and Lemmatization: we explore techniques like stemming and lemmatization to reduce words to their root forms. we learn to implement these techniques and compare their effectiveness in Arabic text processing.

5. Parts of Speech (POS) Techniques: The participant applies parts of speech techniques using both rule-based and machine learning approaches. we gain insights into how to identify and tag different parts of speech in Arabic text, which is essential for tasks like syntactic analysis and information extraction.

6. Named Entity Recognition (NER) Methods: Finally, we learn and applie named entity recognition methods. NER involves identifying and classifying named entities (such as names of persons, organizations, locations, etc.) within text data. we explore various NER algorithms and techniques suitable for Arabic language processing.

Overall, the lab provides a comprehensive understanding of the entire workflow involved in collecting, preprocessing, and analyzing Arabic text data from web sources within a specific domain, utilizing a range of tools and techniques in the process.
